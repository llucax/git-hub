### A script can now be defined to run on certain events (hooks)

When the `hub.hookscript` git configuration is present, it will be used as
a script to run on certain events. For now this feature is considered
experimental and only the `postclone` event is defined. Please have a look at
the `HOOK SCRIPT` section in the man for details.
